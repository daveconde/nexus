## Sonatype Nexus 3.x Chart

Nexus is a repository for storing and caching artifacts.  Based on the initial work done upstream in the kubernetes chart repo [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/1516468/stable/sonatype-nexus).

This chart is deployed when installing Jenkins X on a Kubernetes cluster.  Refer to the [Jenkins X Documentation](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/) for more information.
